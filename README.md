# 🤖 AI-Powered Hybrid Pentesting Agent

## Overview
This project is an **AI-driven cybersecurity agent** that performs both **offensive pentesting (red team)** and **defensive monitoring (blue team)** tasks.  
It automates reconnaissance, exploitation, detection, and response — providing a hybrid system for security researchers, students, and enterprises.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is for **educational and authorized use only**. Do not use against systems you do not own or have permission to test.

## ✨ Features
- 🔴 **Red Team (Attack)**
  - Automated reconnaissance & scanning (Nmap, Gobuster).
  - Exploitation workflows (Metasploit, SQLmap, Hydra).
  - Privilege escalation suggestions.

- 🔵 **Blue Team (Defense)**
  - Log monitoring & anomaly detection (Suricata, Wazuh).
  - AI-powered incident analysis.
  - Automated responses (firewall rules, alerts).

- 📊 **Reporting**
  - AI-generated pentest-style reports.
  - Export to Markdown, HTML, PDF.

- 🌐 **Dashboard (Planned)**
  - Web UI for launching scans and viewing alerts.
  - Real-time visualization of attack/defense.
